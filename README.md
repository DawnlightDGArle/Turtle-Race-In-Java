# Turtle Race In Java
## About This Project
A Turtle Racing simulator programmed in Java using Processing 4. Race 6 turtles at once while also being able to bid on one turtle to win the race. Start with 1000 coins and earn more as you place bets on turtles and win races. Complete with cute turtle icons, colourful start and finish lines and catchy background music to listen to on loop while you race your turtles.

Please note that Processing 4 is currently required to download the .pde file and run the simulation.

## Features
- 6 cute turtles that randomly choose between 2 different skins at the beginning of each race
- Catchy background music to listen to on loop while you race and bid on your turtles
- Colourful start and finish lines
- Custom bids - bid what you like on whichever turtle you'd like... as long as you have enough coins!
- Start with 1000 coins to get you going, win more coins as your turtle places well in races!
